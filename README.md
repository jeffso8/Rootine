# Rootine - A Habit Tracker
This is a web app, where users can keep track of habits they are trying to implement into their daily lives, and visualize their statistics and maintain their habit streaks.

##Table of Contents
1. General Information
2. Technologies
3. Setup 

##General Info 
This project was inspired from the book Atomic Habits. The book's main takeaway is that habits, no matter how atomic, can make a huge impact on ones life in the longer term, but requires consistency. This consistency is simple in theory, but in practice it is much harder without the proper tools. The ability to visualize your habits, see the streaks that you have maintained, and have email/text cues when your habit should be performed are extremely beneficial when the user is trying to stay consistent.

I have created a Test Account that has some features which are built in that you may not be able to see when creating a new account. For example, the previous completed days, and the streaks, habits for individual days, etc.
